## HIV: cascade of care
From the moment of diagnosis until the death of the patient
- Diagnosis
- Registration / enrollment in care
- First clinical visit
- Staging: get CD4 count or clinical state (OMS)
  - To have a CD4 count, normally you have to come to the hospital at least 3 times over 15 days
    - Levels < 500 cl/ml you start ARV
  - To have an OMS clinical state, more or less the same. 
    -Levels 3/4 you start ARV
- Once you have been staged (either CD4 or OMS) then you can have criteria or not to start ARV
  - You get classified as either 
    - Pre-ARV
    - ARV

## Main objective of study

Measure linkage and retention of patients inside this cascade:
  - How many people are in follow-up?
  - How many people are lost to follow-up?
  - Where losses occur, and why?

## Current MoH strategy: Volunteer counseling and testing
  - Other strategies
    - PICT: provided-initiated counseling and testing
    - HBT: home-based testing

## Analysis framework:
  - Left side: linkage and retention
  - Right side: diagnosis venue + confounders

## Secondary objective of study

Cost-effectiveness of each strategy, taking into account
  - Cost of intervention
  - Benefit of retention

## Study design

### Venues
  - VCT: 408 new HIV cases
  - PICT: 408 new HIV cases
  - HBT: 408 new HIV cases

### Followup
  - Passive for 12 months
  - After 12 months, measure linkage and retention
  - People get lost at various steps in the process
